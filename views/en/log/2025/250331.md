I have a 1-0 mode when it comes to running. Either I run or I smoke. I don’t do both at the same time. The day before yesterday, I quit smoking again, and yesterday I went for a run. It won’t be like this forever. But I told myself I’ll stick to this mode for one quarter. As one of my friends says, every day without a cigarette counts.

___P.S.__ The day after my first run, I came down with a fever. There were no more runs after that. But at least I didn’t smoke all week!_
