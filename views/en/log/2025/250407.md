Sometimes my wife, the kids, and I go to a bookstore where everyone gets to pick a book. This time, I picked two â€” one about cold exposure and the other about nutrition. My family found that pretty amusing. To be fair, I often choose books like that, and then they just sit on the shelf at home collecting dust. We'll see how it goes this time :)
