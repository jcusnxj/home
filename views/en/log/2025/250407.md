Sometimes my wife, the kids, and I go to a bookstore where everyone gets to pick a book. This time, I picked two — one about cold exposure and the other about nutrition. My family found that pretty amusing. I get it — I often pick books like this, and then they just end up collecting dust on our bookshelf at home. We’ll see how it goes this time.
