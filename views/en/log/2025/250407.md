Sometimes my wife, the kids, and I go to a bookstore, and everyone gets to pick out a book. This time, I picked out two. One about cold exposure and the other about nutrition. My family found that pretty amusing. I get it. I often choose books like these, and then they just end up gathering dust on our bookshelf at home.
